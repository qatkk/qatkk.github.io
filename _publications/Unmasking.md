    ZK-Rollups improve blockchain scalability and cost efficiency using ZK-SNARKs but lack true transaction privacy. The paper highlights this gap, reviews emerging privacy solutions, and suggests renaming ZK-Rollups to better reflect their actual capabilities.'

The rise of Layer 2 (L2) solutions, including Payment Channel Networks, sidechains, and rollups, has aimed to tackle the scalability challenges of Layer 1 (L1) blockchains like Bitcoin and Ethereum. Among these, Zero-Knowledge Rollups (ZK-Rollups) have emerged as a compelling solution by utilizing ZK-SNARKs to bundle multiple transactions, thereby enhancing throughput and reducing costs. However, despite their technical sophistication, ZK-Rollups do not inherently provide transaction privacy, a common misconception given the “Zero-Knowledge” nomenclature. This paper explores the privacy limitations of ZK-Rollups, emphasizing the need for privacy-preserving features that align with the expectations set by their name. We also review the strategies being developed by various projects to address these limitations. Furthermore, we propose the community begin adapting other names for the technology, such as “Verifiable Rollup”(verRollup),“Incrementally Verifiable Computation Rollup”(ivcRollup), or “Succinct Rollup”(sucRollup) that better represent the current capabilities of rollups. This work contributes to the ongoing discussion on achieving a balance between efficiency, scalability, and privacy in blockchain technologies.
